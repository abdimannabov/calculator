# Calculator.exe

A simple desktop calculator application built in Python. This is my first project as a beginner, and it demonstrates basic arithmetic operations through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear button to reset calculations
- Easy-to-use button layout for digits (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /)

## How to Use
1. **Download/Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. Double-click the **calculator.exe** file to launch the application.
   - Alternatively, if you have Python installed, you can run the Python script directly using `python calculator.py`.
3. Click the buttons to enter your numbers and operations, then press `=` to see the result.
4. Press the **Clear** button to reset and start a new calculation.

## Requirements
- **Windows OS** (for the `.exe` file to run directly)
- *(Optional)* Python 3.x installed if you want to run the `.py` file instead of the `.exe`.
